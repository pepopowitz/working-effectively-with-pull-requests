<!--
I said this is a talk about culture, and I want to share my favorite analogy

of culture as a community garden.

When you find a situation with good culture, it's like walking into a community garden that produces the best fruits and vegetables.

The carrots taste delicious, and you don't want to leave.

But the carrots don't grow themselves. The people in the community cultivate them.

When weeds start to take over, someone needs to pull them.

You can rely on someone else to do it, and still enjoy the carrots,

but you can also contribute.


Calling out bad acts in pull request reviews is a small but important contribution to the weeding of the carrots. It's critical to keeping the garden healthy.

# Be aware of <br/>**power dynamics**.

Power dynamics have a huge impact on collaboration, especially in the interpretation of ambiguous communication.

<!-- _header: "1 | **2: Ground rules.** _Be aware of power dynamics._ | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 "  -->

## If you aren't **aware** of a power dynamic, you're probably on the **strong** side of it.

<!--
Power dynamics appear in every relationship we have.
You certainly know about them when you're on the weaker side of it.
And when you don't know about a power dynamic in a relationship, there's a good chance it's because you're on the stronger side.
-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | **2: Ground rules.** _Be aware of power dynamics._ | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 "  -->

## Power dynamics can be **conflicting**.

<!--
For example,

I interact with my boss in my PRs every day.
She's my boss - that's one power dynamic, in which I am on the weaker side.

On the other hand, she looks to me for many technical details and decisions.

That's a power dynamic in the opposite direction, and it also appears in the interactions we have in a PR.
-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | **2: Ground rules.** | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 "  -->

# Be aware of **power dynamics**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) Choose words with care and intention.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Be explicit instead of implicit.

<!--
These exist in almost every relationship we have.

They can be problematic, but we can also navigate them successfully in a team.

We really just need to be aware of them.

...

And the weight of our words, especially when we're on the strong side of the dynamic.

...

I think the best way to avoid misinterpretation of words in a power dynamic

is to be explicit instead of implicit.

When something isn't that important, SAY SO.

When it is important, SAY SO.

Don't leave it up to the reader to interpret.

Feedback from the strong side takes on a very heavy weight. That weight can easily elevate something from "doesn't matter" to "matters very much," even if it doesn't.

often it's easier to notice others using unclear ambiguous language, so help them out by letting them know you don't understand

...

If something is unclear, get more information.

...

Make it clear what you will do and what you won't;
what you're expecting and what you're not expecting.

...

Assumptions, context, conclusions...all of these things can easily be misinterpreted. State them explicitly.

# Communicate effectively **asynchronously**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) Minimize round trips.

<!--
And we need to especially *focus* on asynchronous communication.
Collaborating through PRs is *inherently asynchronous*, and with that comes some *really great* things.
We can *collaborate across time and location*.
People can *respond when it's the right time* for them, because *right now might not be the best time.
So everyone can *take their time before responding*.

And that means we get their

- best focus
- best ideas
- best self

(pause)

But there is *slowness* to asynchronous communication. That can be really *frustrating*.

The most important thing you can do to *prevent that pain*,

...

is to minimize round trips.

And that means doing all the *things we've talked about*.

Providing context, clarity, radiating intent, removing ambiguity

giving the reader enough to go on so that they don't need to ask questions.

## Break up changes that require a **different mindset** to review.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) By architectural layer.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) By infrastructural vs implementation.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) By risky vs routine.

<!--
this is my guidance for separating pull requests

when a PR contains different types of work that require different mindets to review, it's more likely to draw the LGTM response, which usually means "there were too many things going on and I didn't totally get it all, but I inherently trust you."

1 - api vs front-end, etc
2 - infra invites more thorough review of concepts; implementation is more "are you following the existing patterns."
  - includes the "walking skeleton" approach, where you start with a PR that just puts the infrastructure in place so that different parts _can_ function together...then implementing each of the functions into the skeleton.
3 - routine work that follows existing patterns usually gets "hey you missed this" type of feedback; novel work that takes thoughtful consideration of approaches invites more theoretical feedback.

Ideally you can do this with separate PRs.
If you can't, at the very least practice good commit hygiene so that reviewers may easily review the risky changes separate from the routine changes, for example.

1 - use the draft feature if you remember it exists üòÖ just make sure it's clearly marked as experimental/incomplete.

2 - build prototypes that reviewers can play with by checking out the PR's branch

3 - build the infrastructure for a feature, and let people review that before you fill in the guts.

<!--

1 - assign the PR to someone, and add reviewers...

2 - whether documented or enforced by convention or automation

## Be **respectful**.

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5: Good PR reviews.** _Communicate effectively._ | 6 "  -->

## Be direct.

> "**What do you think** about doing X instead of Y?"

> "I think **we should do** X instead of Y, because Z."

<!--

a few years ago I started doing this thing where I wanted to be extra friendly and considerate

And I'd put comments phrased like the top

But what I really meant was the bottom

The top was too indirect and passive

The top can be fine if you really don't have an opinion,

just make sure you're saying what you mean.

-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5: Good PR reviews.** _Communicate effectively._ | 6 "  -->

## Ask questions.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) Don't make assumptions.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Get help understanding the things you don't understand.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) Take it synchronous if it's still unclear.

<!--

remember, curiosity over judgement

1 - when something doesn't make sense, it usually doesn't mean the author is dumb, it means you don't understand how they approached the problem

2 - and then ask them to explain it so you can understand it

3 - if things go back and forth more than a couple times in comments, don't be afraid to take it to a synchronous conversation

just make sure that any decisions that come out of that conversation, or discoveries, or anything interesting, makes its way back to the PR as a comment.

# Good reviews request changes <br/> **for the right reasons**.

<!--

and I've got some bad news for you ...

-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5: Good PR reviews.** _Request changes for the right reasons._ | 6 "  -->

## **You** define **The Right Reasons**.

<!--

I'm not going to tell you what the right reasons are

I recommend you establish a team agreement on what is fair game for requesting changes

-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5: Good PR reviews.** _Request changes for the right reasons._ | 6 "  -->

## Are these **The Right Reasons**?

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) The code could be more readable.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Code that was not added or edited in the PR is wrong.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) The syntax doesn't match my preference.

<!--

1 - careful! it's subjective

if I've got a function that needs to do four unrelated things in sequence, and each thing takes 2 lines of code,
would you rather see everything happen in one function, or one function that calls 4 2-line functions?

functional programmer's code vs javascript developers?

my personal rule is that I don't request changes for readability
unless I can use specific language about why it is not readable enough

2 - how wrong does it have to be to warrant sneaking into this PR vs creating another?

3 - my rule: if you can't give a subjective reason the code is improved, it's taste, and no one wins.

But, if you're a dictator & subjects power dynamic, the dictator wins

...

all this to say, establish a working agreement!

-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5: Good PR reviews.** _Request changes for the right reasons._ | 6 "  -->

## Other guidance for requesting changes

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) Be explicit about **power dynamics**.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Practice **curiosity over judgement**.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) Let the **robots** help.

<!--

1 - dictator & subjects? (aka DRI)

2 - Why did they do it differently than I would have?

- Does it even matter?

- Will I be able to understand this code when I stumble across it in 3 months?

3 - automate as much as possible

- prettier, linting, etc

- if any frequent manual checks can be automated, do it! that should be a robot's job.

# Good reviews **provide context**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1) Tell them **why** the code should change.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
2) Point to **other code**.
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
3) Point to **conversations** outside of GitHub.

<!--

1
If there's a reason something needs to change, give them information about why
- why can't a variable be named X here?
- what is the negative impact that they're not seeing?
- share your understanding of the system
- don't just say "this won't work", tell them what the effect in the system will be
- there is a balance - be careful about excessive teaching because it can be condescending, and establish an unwanted power dynamic.

2
- what's an example they can follow?

3
- (conversations, tickets, etc)

# Good reviews <br/>**give direction**.

---

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5: Good PR reviews.** _Give direction._ | 6 "  -->

## 1. Use the **suggestion** feature.

![width:900](images/aside-suggesting.png)

<!--

Allows a person to commit the prescribed changes directly in the GitHub UI.

Especially nice for very small changes.

Becomes more difficult to manage when there are synchronized suggestions in multiple places,
like changing a variable name.

-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5: Good PR reviews.** _Give direction._ | 6 "  -->

## 2. Explicitly **assign responsibilities**.

![width:900](images/aside-reassign.png)

<!--

- assign to someone to take action, if it isn't obvious.
- e.g. "assigning to you to merge when you feel the test coverage is adequate"

-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | **5: Good PR reviews.** _Give direction._ | 6 "  -->

## 3. State **the importance** of addressing the feedback.

<!--

clearly!

- Is this feedback blocking or non-blocking?
- are you expecting them to address this in this PR? another?
- how much does it matter to you that they address it?
  - if you're picking nits, and you don't really care much if they're fixed, they might not know that
  - especially depending on the power dynamic.
  - I sometimes use the 1 to 10 on the "give a shit" meter to describe how much I care.

## The **author** has responsibilities <br/>to **support maintainers**.

<!--

So they don't burn out

If the maintainer asks you to rebase on `main`, you should do that.

You may ask for help if you don't know how to do the thing they're asking you to do...

But it is important to abide by the norms of the project, which unfortunately vary from one project to another.

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | **6: Final thoughts.** "  -->

## The **maintainers** have responsibilities <br/>to **support contributors**.

<!--

at the same time....

...to remove friction

and enable people to contribute as easily as possible

because gatekeeping contributions to a project, whether intentional or unintentional, is a good way to prevent contributions.

-->

---

<!-- _header: "1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | **6: Final thoughts.** "  -->

## The best way to **maintain this balance** is to <br/>**establish norms** and **communicate** them clearly.

<!--

through some sort of agreement
